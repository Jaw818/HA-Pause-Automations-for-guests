# 🎉 Pause Automations When Guests Are Over!

Welcome to the chill zone of Home Assistant automations 😎  
This project lets you **temporarily suspend automations** when friends or family are visiting—so your house doesn't suddenly start shutting down for the night while you're hosting!

At our place, the home starts winding down around 11 PM—lights dim, things turn off—unless we're not home or far away. But when guests are over, we want things to stay lively. That’s where this comes in!

---

## 🚀 How It Works (Right Now)

Currently, I'm using **simple input fields** inside a **Browser Mod pop-up card** to toggle guest mode.  

But I’ve got future plans! 🧠  
I'm working on integrating **object detection via cameras** to auto-detect more than the usual number of cars in the driveway. Automation meets AI... coming soon.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Required Integrations
- 🍄 [Mushroom Card](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom) – Beautiful UI components  
- 🎨 [Card Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) – Add some flair and customization  
- 🌐 [Browser Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod) – Enables pop-ups and device-specific actions  

### Required Helpers
- `input_button.friends_button`  
- `input_datetime.what_time_are_friends_coming`  
- `input_boolean.friends`  

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Automations

### ✅ Initial Automation  
YAML: [Friends Are Coming Over](https://github.com/Jaw818/HA-Pause-Automations-for-guests/blob/main/automation-main)

This automation uses the helpers to:
- Determine if guests are arriving **before or after sunset**
- Turn on **outdoor lighting** 30 minutes before sunset
- Factor in **weather conditions** (e.g., rainy nights = lights on!)
- Optionally trigger **extra lighting**, like entryways or decorative lights
- **Disable specific automations** you don’t want running while guests are over (e.g., lights-out at 11 PM)

You can even go next-level and use **lux sensors** to make lighting decisions based on real-world brightness!

### 👋 When Everyone's Left  
YAML: [Friends Left](https://github.com/Jaw818/HA-Pause-Automations-for-guests/blob/main/Automation-Disabled)

This automation flips everything back to normal when the `input_boolean.friends` is set to `off`.

But what if you forget to turn it off?  
I’ve got you covered with a backup YAML: [Forgot To Turn Off](https://github.com/Jaw818/HA-Pause-Automations-for-guests/blob/main/automation-forgot)  
This automation resets the guest mode **at 4 AM**, just in case.

## 🖼️ Step 2: The Card UI

Okay, full honesty—I didn’t go wild with styling here. It’s built to *work*, not to *win beauty contests*.

### 🎯 Activation Button  
![activation-button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f826bc5-3797-4fab-98eb-6ad54aff3a6a)

Used to open the pop-up for setting guest options: [Pop-up Activation Button](https://github.com/Jaw818/HA-Pause-Automations-for-guests/blob/main/activation-button)
I place this button among others in a row on my main dashboard for quick access.

### 💬 Pop-Up UI  
Here’s the actual pop-up card that shows the input fields:

### 🟩 Conditional Tile  
A slick [tile card](https://github.com/Jaw818/HA-Pause-Automations-for-guests/blob/main/conditional-tile) shows up **only when `friends` is ON**—just tap it to turn guest mode off easily.

## 💡 Wrapping Up

This setup helps keep the vibe going when you're entertaining, without having to disable all your automations manually.  
Feel free to fork, tweak, or level it up with AI, presence detection, or more sensors!

Happy automating 🏡✨
